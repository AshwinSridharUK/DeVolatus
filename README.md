# Story
Care homes have been one of the worst affected by the COVID pandemic, with high levels of transmission. Care workers have had to adapt to the pandemic, with a more demanding workload, exacerbated by poor digital infrastructure. From tracking testing results to PPE stock, care homes struggle with collecting and managing data. In turn, growing concerns over the safety of transmissions across care homes, have heightened restrictions, leading to many missing out on meeting their loved ones. An all-in-one solution, which can help care workers to track vital data securely is necessary.

# Introduction: DeVolatus
Meet Devolatus, the multi-functional smart IoT dashboard, helping to make care homes a safe space by improving digital infrastructure and logistics tracking.

The device allows care home workers to track capacity and sends reminders whenever capacity is reached. Moreover, the dashboard helps workers keep track of vital supplies (e.g. PPE), providing reminders when stocks are low. The system uses AWS IoT + Analytics and SNS to store all relevant data safely and securely and send notifications accordingly.
